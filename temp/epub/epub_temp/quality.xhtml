            <p class="p">Although the site does provide a great deal of information, it failed to include any
               task topics. The site does not inform the user how to become an involved in InclusiveVT.
               It would have been helpful if there was a task topic titled "How to Become Involved".
               Although InclusiveVT is meant to be mainly informative, a few task topics would have
               been helpful.

            <p class="p">As a whole, the site appears to be complete, but it could be improved with task topics.
               Currently, the site mainly consists of information about events and concepts, Tasks
               would make the site more complete by allowing the user to use the site based on their
               needs and interests.
